## Description

Lo-Fi Lullabies is a custom, mobile-responsive music playing application with a simple user interface that features some animation. With Lo-Fi Lullabies you can browse and play up to ten different tracks.

The application utilizes the Audio API (play method, pause method, timeupdate event, etc.) and features a dynamic progress bar that can be used to skip around the track that is being played.
